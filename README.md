## Script that scrapes data on forward contracts from the Polish electricity exchange (TGE)

The repository contains a scraping script that downloads data from the Polish energy exchange and saves it in CSV files. The data consists of forward contracts, which are much more difficult to obtain automatically than publicly available data on the Day-Ahead Market.  Thanks to this solution, analytical processes in energy companies can proceed smoothly in the Polish energy sector without the need for manual data collection. Such solutions are essential for obtaining information and analyses of the dynamically changing electricity market.
